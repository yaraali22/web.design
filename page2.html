<div class ="typing-text">My name is Yara Tarkhan, and I'm a 22-year-old, I have a Bachelor's degree in Network and Security Engineering from
     Jordan University of Science and Technology.
    I've always thought that a person's genuine worth comes from their experiences and commitment, not merely from a number on a piece of paper. 
    I became interested in computers at a young age because my family was very interested in technology. 
    A strong work ethic and a will to succeed were ingrained in me by my diversified upbringing. Network engineering isn't simply my area of expertise; 
    it also serves as the fuel for my ambition to lead, collaborate, and invent.<br>
    In five years, I see myself as a network security expert, working for a large technology company.
    I hope to have gained additional skills and certifications in the field of cybersecurity, 
    and to be able to contribute to the development of new security technologies and protocols.</div>
